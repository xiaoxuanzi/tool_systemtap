#tool for tcp
#! /usr/bin/env stap
#This section illustrates how to monitor incoming TCP connections. This task is useful in 
#identifying any unauthorized, suspicious, or otherwise unwanted network access requests in real time.
#While tcp_connections.stp is running, it will print out the following information about any incoming TCP 
#connections accepted by the system in real time:
#Current UID
#CMD - the command accepting the connection
#PID of the command
#Port used by the connection
#IP address from which the TCP connection originated
